            Students are responsible for thoroughly reading and understanding
            all rules regarding admission, as well as being familiar with
            certification/results, syllabus, and course content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each student is required to attend either a batch or individual
            lectures as per mutually agreed timings between the student and the
            administrators.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Institute reserves the right to cancel a student's admission
            within 15 days if the student fails to update their status and
            subsequently misses fee installments or neglects document processes,
            despite repeated announcements. The organization shall not be held
            accountable in any way in such instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students must follow the department head's and other institutional
            staff members' instructions.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a student's behavior is found to be rough, arrogant, lacking in
            discipline, causing harm to the organization, or involved in any act
            of ragging during their course of education at this institute, their
            admission may be cancelled, and they may be expelled from the
            institute without prior notice. No refund of fees will be provided
            in such cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            The student is accountable for any loss or damage to books,
            equipment, furniture, or other institutional property caused by
            their negligence. The institution's assessment of the loss will be
            deemed final.
          </li>
          <li>
            The organization is not liable for any misrepresentation or events
            occurring with students outside the institution, including during
            institute events, picnics, commutes between home and the institute,
            and involvement in social media groups created by others.
            Additionally, the organization is not responsible for any data leaks
            from social media, system faults, loss of important data, personal
            affairs, financial issues, theft of valuable items, or other
            incidents between batch mates and colleagues. Each individual
            student is responsible for their own actions in these situations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students must complete their selected course within the specified
            time duration. However, a grace period of one month (for short-term
            courses less than one year) and two months (for long-term courses
            more than one year) will be granted. Otherwise, additional charges
            will be applied for carry forward.
          </li>
          <li>Students must submit leave applications in advance.</li>
          <li>
            Course transfers are not permitted, neither from one course to
            another nor from one student to another.

          <li>
            The course content and curriculum may be subject to change based on

          Certification

        <ul class="text-justify list-outside list-disc mx-auto px-10">
          <li>
            Students are required to maintain an average attendance of 90%
            throughout the duration of their course. Failure to meet this
            attendance requirement may result in the institute not being able to
            provide job placement assistance (if promised at the time of
            admission).
          </li>
          <li>
            If a student leaves the course unfinished, if some course content
            remains incomplete, or if there are unpaid fees, they will not be
            eligible for job placement (if any promised at the time of
            admission), certification, or any other benefits provided by the
            organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            The certificate will be graded based on overall student performance,

            learning term.

          Fees, Fines & Refund Policy
        </h4>

        <ul class="text-justify list-outside list-disc mx-auto mb-10 px-10">
          <li>
            Students must pay their instalments on or before the 10th of every
            month (or as per center notification). Failure to do so will result
            in the imposition of late fee charges as determined by the
            institute.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a student pays fees through a third-party application, they are
            responsible for any charges applicable to the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Except in the case of cancellation of the course before
            commencement, the institute does not provide any refunds of fees.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a student remains absent for more than 20 days without sanctioned
            leave, charges will be imposed for re-admission as determined by the
            institute.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a student discontinues their studies for more than 30 days
            without prior written approval from the institute, they will be
            terminated from the current course. If the student returns after 31
            days, it will be considered as a new admission, and the course
            structure and fees applicable at that time will apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            If any student's attendance falls below 85% throughout the duration
            of their course, they will be required to pay extra lab charges
            every month until the end of the course (after the grace period).
            The extra lab charges will be equivalent to the monthly installment
            of the existing course. If a student maintains above 85% attendance
            but the course remains incomplete, no extra lab charges need to be
            paid.

        <ul class="text-justify list-outside list-disc mx-auto px-10">

            The Institute reserves the right to modify these rules at any time,

            continuing your enrollment, you agree to abide by the updated rules.
