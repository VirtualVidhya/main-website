  overview:
    "This course is designed to help you master Python from the ground up, giving you the skills to build everything from simple scripts to real-world applications. Over 2-3 months, you'll learn how to write, test, and debug Python programs, making you proficient in one of the most versatile and widely used programming languages. You'll start with basic programming concepts, including writing simple scripts, handling user input, and using loops and conditions. As you progress, you'll explore functions, file handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), and working with external libraries, which are essential for web development, data analysis, automation, and AI/ML applications. By the end of this course, you'll be able to build real-world projects, automate repetitive tasks, analyze data, and develop web applications. Whether you want to become a software developer, data scientist, or AI engineer, this course will provide a strong foundation for your journey into Python programming.",
