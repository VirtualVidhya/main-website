  overview:
    "This Scratch Programming Course is designed for school-going kids to introduce them to the world of coding in a fun and interactive way. Scratch, developed by MIT, is a visual block-based programming language that allows kids to create games, animations, and interactive stories without needing to write complex code. Through this course, kids will learn logical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity while building their own projects. By using Scratch's drag-and-drop interface, they will understand the fundamentals of coding, including loops, variables, and conditionals, in an engaging way. By the end of the course, students will be able to design and develop their own mini-games, animations, and interactive applications, giving them a strong foundation in programming.",
