        General Integrity

      <ul class="text-left list-outside list-disc pl-5">
        <li>
          Students are responsible for thoroughly reading and understanding all
          rules regarding admission, as well as being familiar with
          certification/results, syllabus, and course content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each student is required to attend either a batch or individual
          lectures as per mutually agreed timings between the student and the
          administrators.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Institute reserves the right to cancel a student's admission
          within 15 days if the student fails to update their status and
          subsequently misses fee installments or neglects document processes,
          despite repeated announcements. The organization shall not be held
          accountable in any way in such instances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Students must follow the department head's and other institutional
          staff members' instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a student's behavior is found to be rough, arrogant, lacking in
          discipline, causing harm to the organization, or involved in any act
          of ragging during their course of education at this institute, their
          admission may be cancelled, and they may be expelled from the
          institute without prior notice. No refund of fees will be provided in
          such cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          The student is accountable for any loss or damage to books, equipment,
          furniture, or other institutional property caused by their negligence.
          The institution's assessment of the loss will be deemed final.
        </li>
        <li>
          The organization is not liable for any misrepresentation or events
          occurring with students outside the institution, including during
          institute events, picnics, commutes between home and the institute,
          and involvement in social media groups created by others.
          Additionally, the organization is not responsible for any data leaks
          from social media, system faults, loss of important data, personal
          affairs, financial issues, theft of valuable items, or other incidents
          between batch mates and colleagues. Each individual student is
          responsible for their own actions in these situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Students must complete their selected course within the specified time
          duration. However, a grace period of one month (for short-term courses
          less than one year) and two months (for long-term courses more than
          one year) will be granted. Otherwise, additional charges will be
          applied for carry forward.
        </li>
        <li>Students must submit leave applications in advance.</li>
        <li>
          Course transfers are not permitted, neither from one course to another
          nor from one student to another.
        </li>
        <li>
          The course content and curriculum may be subject to change based on
          industry standards and the capabilities of the students.

        Certification
      </h4>

      <ul class="text-left list-outside list-disc pl-5">
        <li>
          Students are required to maintain an average attendance of 90%
          throughout the duration of their course. Failure to meet this
          attendance requirement may result in the institute not being able to
          provide job placement assistance (if promised at the time of
          admission).
        </li>
        <li>
          If a student leaves the course unfinished, if some course content
          remains incomplete, or if there are unpaid fees, they will not be
          eligible for job placement (if any promised at the time of admission),
          certification, or any other benefits provided by the organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          The certificate will be graded based on overall student performance,
          including assignments, projects, and exams completed during the
          learning term.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Fees, Fines & Refund Policy
      </h4>

      <ul class="text-left list-outside list-disc pl-5 mb-10">
        <li>
          Students must pay their instalments on or before the 10th of every
          month (or as per center notification). Failure to do so will result in
          the imposition of late fee charges as determined by the institute.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a student pays fees through a third-party application, they are
          responsible for any charges applicable to the application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Except in the case of cancellation of the course before commencement,
          the institute does not provide any refunds of fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a student remains absent for more than 20 days without sanctioned
          leave, charges will be imposed for re-admission as determined by the
          institute.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a student discontinues their studies for more than 30 days without
          prior written approval from the institute, they will be terminated
          from the current course. If the student returns after 31 days, it will
          be considered as a new admission, and the course structure and fees
          applicable at that time will apply.
        </li>
        <li>
          If any student's attendance falls below 85% throughout the duration of
          their course, they will be required to pay extra lab charges every
          month until the end of the course (after the grace period). The extra
          lab charges will be equivalent to the monthly installment of the
          existing course. If a student maintains above 85% attendance but the
          course remains incomplete, no extra lab charges need to be paid.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="text-left list-outside list-disc pl-5">
        <li>
          The Institute reserves the right to modify these rules at any time, if
          deemed necessary. Any changes will be effective immediately upon
          posting on our website or other official communication channels. By
          continuing your enrollment, you agree to abide by the updated rules.
